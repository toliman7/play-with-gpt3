# Play with GPT-3
GPT-3 jupyer notebooks



## Prerequists to run the notebook

The best way is to start with a python virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv
```

Please install qiskit and dependent libraries

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## To run the notebook

First you need to get an API-Key from OpenAI. They have a trial period for which you can get limited access.
Put the API key in an environment variable and start the notebook:


```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
jupyter notebook
```

This will open the home screen of jupyter from which you can select and open the file.
